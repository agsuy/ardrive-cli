# ardrive-cli
The ArDrive Command Line Interface (CLI) Beta contains all of the needed public file synchronization and Arweave wallet capabilities via a Node.js application.  This works in unison with the ArDrive Web App.

This app is currently in beta testing, and as such may have bugs and does not offer Private/Encrypted Drives.

To use the ArDrive CLI, install it with your favorite package manager, and run "ardrive-cli"

```
$ npm i ardrive-cli -g
$ ardrive-cli
```
